## About Me

I am a full-stack developer, experienced in building both the frontend and backend of web applications. My main focus recently has been working with **APIs**, **PostgreSQL**, and **TypeScript** in **Node.js**. I love diving deep into backend architectures and ensuring robust and scalable APIs for modern web applications.

Technologies I work with:

- **Frontend**: React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL
- **Tools**: Docker, Git, pg, node-pg-migrate

In addition to my technical work, I'm also improving my **English skills** and planning to take my development career internationally. I'm currently pursuing opportunities in **Australia** or **Ireland**.
